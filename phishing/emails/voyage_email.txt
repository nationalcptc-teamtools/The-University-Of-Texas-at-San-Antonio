All, 

I hope this email finds you well. 
We have a pressing and time-sensitive matter that requires your immediate attention. 
We are ensuring our newest addition to the fleet has a successful maiden voyage, and we will be having a company-wide sendoff event.
Please fill out this attached document with your information for a headcount. 
The deadline for action is 2 PM today.
