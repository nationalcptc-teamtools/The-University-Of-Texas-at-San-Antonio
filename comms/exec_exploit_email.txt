Subject: Notice: Controlled exploitation of [VULN-ID] on [ASSET]

Dear <POC_NAME>,

Please be advised that, as part of our contracted penetration test of <CLIENT>, we have identified <DESCRIBE VULN> affecting [asset(s)]. 
We will perform a controlled exploitation to validate impact on [date/time, time zone]. Expected operational impact is [none/minor/brief disruption]. 

Safeguards include request throttling, non-destructive payloads, and immediate cleanup. CENTRAL-05 will halt activity in case of any unexpected behavior.

Additionally, please inform us as soon as possible if exploitation is an immediate concern for this asset.

Our team will cease any exploitation attempts if that is the case and provide a theoretical proof-of-concept instead in our final report.

For immediate concerns or to discuss scheduling if needed for testing, please contact CENTRAL-05.

Thank you very much,
CENTRAL-05
